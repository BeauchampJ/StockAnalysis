## How to use
The file promts the user for most things that are needed, but before running it's important to download and import a .csv from yahoo finance (more information found in csv_files)

## TODO
- [x] Insert ability to graph all of the data vs time 
- [x] Add candlestick plots **Still needs some work to make them better looking**
- [ ] Add ability to import multiple csv files at once
- [x] Add functions for data analysis (ie: 50/200 day moving average) **Still needs more**

## How to use
The file promts the user for most things that are needed, but before running it's important to download and import a .csv from yahoo finance (more information found in csv_files)

## TODO
- [ ] Insert ability to graph all of the data vs time in subplots
- [ ] Add ability to import multiple csv files at once
- [ ] Add functions for data analysis (ie: 50/200 day moving average)
